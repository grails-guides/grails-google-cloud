We are going to deploy the Grails application developed in this guide to the
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/[Google App Engine Flexible Environment]

> App Engine allows developers to focus on doing what they do best: writing code. Based on Google Compute Engine, the App Engine flexible environment automatically scales your app up and down while balancing the load. Microservices, authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, versioning, security scanning, and content delivery networks are all supported natively.

Run the command:

`gcloud app create`

to initialize an App Engine application within the current Google Cloud project.

NOTE: You will need to choose the region where you want your App Engine Application located.
