We are going to deploy the Grails application developed in this guide to the https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/[Google App Engine Flexible Environment]
____
App Engine allows developers to focus on doing what they do best: writing code. Based on Google Compute Engine,
the App Engine flexible environment automatically scales your app up and down while balancing the load. Microservices,
authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, versioning, security scanning, and content delivery networks are all supported natively.
____

Run the command:

[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud app create
