As the home page of the application, we want to display the books persisted when the application started ( in `BootStrap.groovy`)

We map the home page to be resolved by `BookController`.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy[indent=0,tag=homeUrlMapping]
----

We have modified slightly the output of Grails static scaffolding command `generate-all`
to provide CRUD functionality for the domain class `Book`.

You can find the code: `BookController`, `BookGormService` and GSP views in <<appendixA,the appendix>>.
