To deploy to Google App Engine, we need to add the file `src/main/appengine/app.yaml`

It describes the application's deployment configuration:

[source,groovy]
./src/main/appengine/app.yaml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/appengine/app.yaml[indent=0]
----

Here, `app.yaml` specifies the runtime used by the app, and sets `env: flex`,
specifying that the app uses the https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/[flexible environment].

NOTE: The minimal `app.yaml` application configuration file shown above is sufficient for a simple Grails application.
Depending on the size, complexity, and features that your application uses, you may need to change and extend this basic
configuration file. For more information on what can be configured via `app.yaml`, please see the
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml[Configuring Your App with app.yaml]
guide.

For more information on how the Java runtime works, see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/dev-jetty9[Java 8 / Jetty 9.3 Runtime].
